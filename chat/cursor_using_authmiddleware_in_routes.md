how to use authMiddleware in the routes

**Cursor**

I'll help you understand how to use the authMiddleware in your routes. Let me first examine the current auth middleware and then look at how it's being used in your routes.


Now let me check how the routes are currently structured to see if authMiddleware is already being used:


Now I can see the current setup. The auth middleware (`authenticateToken`) is defined but not being used in the routes yet. Let me show you how to properly implement it in your routes.

Based on your code, here's how to use the `authenticateToken` middleware in your routes:

## 1. Update the Groups Routes

The groups routes should be protected since they require authentication. Here's how to modify them:


```typescript
import { Router } from 'express';
import { createGroup, getGroupById } from '../controllers/groupController';
import { authenticateToken } from '../middleware/auth';

const router = Router();

/**
 * @route   POST /groups/
 * @desc    Create a new group
 * @access  Private (requires authentication)
 */
router.post('/', authenticateToken, createGroup);

/**
 * @route   GET /groups/:groupId
 * @desc    Get a specific group by ID (user must be a member)
 * @access  Private (requires authentication)
 */
router.get('/:groupId', authenticateToken, getGroupById);

export default router;
```

## 2. How the Auth Middleware Works

The `authenticateToken` middleware:

1. **Extracts the token** from the `Authorization` header (expects format: `Bearer <token>`)
2. **Verifies the JWT token** using your `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
3. **Finds the user** in the database using the decoded user ID
4. **Attaches the user** to the request object as `req.user`
5. **Calls `next()`** to continue to the route handler if authentication succeeds
6. **Returns an error** if authentication fails

## 3. How to Use in Controllers

Your controllers are already set up to use the authenticated user. Notice in your `groupController.ts`:

```typescript
export interface CreateGroupRequest extends AuthenticatedRequest {
   body: {}
}
```

The `AuthenticatedRequest` interface extends the base `Request` and adds the optional `user` property. This means after the middleware runs, you can access `req.user` in your controllers.

## 4. Example Usage Pattern

Here's the complete flow:

1. **Client sends request** with Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

2. **Middleware processes** the token and attaches user to `req.user`

3. **Controller receives** the request with the authenticated user:
   ```typescript
   const userId = req.user?._id.toString();
   ```

## 5. Alternative Ways to Apply Middleware

You can also apply the middleware in different ways:

### Apply to all routes in a router:
```typescript
const router = Router();
router.use(authenticateToken); // All routes in this router require auth
```

### Apply to specific HTTP methods:
```typescript
router.use(['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'], authenticateToken); // Only these methods require auth
```

### Apply to multiple routes at once:
```typescript
router.use(['/groups', '/movies'], authenticateToken); // Multiple route prefixes
```

## 6. Testing the Authentication

To test your protected routes, you'll need to:

1. **Get a token** by calling your auth endpoint
2. **Include the token** in the Authorization header
3. **Make requests** to protected routes

The middleware will now protect your group routes, ensuring only authenticated users can create and access groups. The auth routes (`/auth`) remain unprotected since users need to authenticate first to get tokens.

```typescript
export interface CreateGroupRequest extends AuthenticatedRequest {
   body: {}
}
```

```plaintext
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

```typescript
   const userId = req.user?._id.toString();
```

```typescript
const router = Router();
router.use(authenticateToken); // All routes in this router require auth
```

```typescript
router.use(['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'], authenticateToken); // Only these methods require auth
```

```typescript
router.use(['/groups', '/movies'], authenticateToken); // Multiple route prefixes
```
